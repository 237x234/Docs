No other information outside of the above mentioned one will be stored.

### Updating Data
The data may be updated when using specific commands.  
Updating data will require the input of an end user and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

### Temporarely stored Information
The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.  
When this time passes will the cached information be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data
Stored Data may be removed by either removing the bot from a Server, through the means of kicking or banning it, or by requesting the removal of the data through E-Mail.  
We reserve the right to ask for verification of Ownership of the Server, if removal was requested through E-Mail to prevent any possible abuse. This means that only the Server owner may ask for the removal of data from their Server through E-Mail.  
E-Mail requests should go towards support@purrbot.site.

!!! info "Limitations"
    We try our best to remove the data when needed but due to the nature of the bot may it happen that through certain periots of time, such as when the bot undergoes maintenance and therefore is offline, or when there is an issue with the host or Service Provider (Discord) causing connection-issues, that the stored data won't get removed correctly.  
    In such cases may you request the manual removal through E-Mail with the conditions as described above.
