# Contribute towards the Projects
We're always happy for people who want to help us improve our various projects.  
But before you blindly dive into the stuff, keep the following things in mind.

## Documentation/Wiki
The documentation (The site you're currently on) is located [here][doc] and we're happy over every improvement made, being it fixing style-issues, or even just correcting minor typos.

When you want to update pages, make sure to follow the instructions on the [Readme][doc] to not getting any formatting issues.  
The easiest way to edit a page is by clicking the pencil icon on the top right of it. This will imediatally open the page in the Online editor of GitHub (Requires you to have a GitHub account).  
Once you made your changes, propose the file-changes and create a PR for it.

## Bot
I (Andre_601) are not the best developer, so there are sure some problematic Coding decision made in the code of [\*Purr\*][purr].  
That's why I'm always happy to receive Pull requests to improve and fix things.  
Please make sure to follow the [contributing guidelines][contributing] for the repository.

## APIs
Similar to the bot are the APIs not the best in terms of code.  
Feel free to submit any Pull requests to improve them.

You can find the source codes [here][imageapi] and [here][purrbotapi].

We welcome every kind of translation. This even includes those that don't really exist (Are a joke-language like Klingon... No hate towards those guys).  
Please head over to the [Translations-Repository][translation] and read the information about how to submit your Translation.
