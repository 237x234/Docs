# API Documentation
Welcome to the documentation of the APIs of PurrBot.site!

The APIs consists of two separate APIs which work independant from each other: The PurrBotAPI and the ImageAPI.

## PurrBotAPI
The PurrBotAPI was created to generate images that either look like messages from Discord, or an avatar with a status icon attached (Similar to how avatars look in a user profile).

## ImageAPI
The ImageAPI was created as a replacement for the nekos.life API. Similar to that API does this one serve randomly selected images, based on what path you provided.  
The reason behind the creation of this API was, to have more control over what images are displayed, as the nekos.life API may display images that can be considered against Discord's ToS (e.g. Depicting NSFW-lolis).
