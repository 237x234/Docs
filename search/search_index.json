The images are hosted on our own site ( https://purrbot.site ) and provided through our own API .

We constantly expand our collection of images and are happy over every submitted image from you, if they meet our requirements. If you find images on our site, that break the ToS of Discord (i.e. depicting NSFW-Lolis), let us know about this, by either joining our Discord server or sending an E-Mail at support@purrbot.site !

Who/What is *Snuggle* and can I invite her? *Snuggle* is the Beta-Version of *Purr* and is used to test new commands/features before *Purr* is receiving them. She cannot be invited through normal ways. To invite her will you need to be a Patreon Member of the highest tier (Catnip) and contact Andre_601. He will then join your Discord, where you want *Snuggle* to be and invites her (You need to temporary give him manage server permission for this). Why does the bot not work with Administrator? When you gave *Purr* the Administrator permission will she refuse to perform any command and send an error message instead. This was essentially made to force people into setting permissions up properly, since just giving Administrator is not something good to do. If you don't want to manually set up *Purr* with all required permissions, invite her using this invite to have a *Purr* role with all required permissions set up. On what is the bot/website hosted? The bot is hosted on a VPS running Ubuntu 18.04 and with Java 11 (OpenJDK) . It uses RethinkDB as database. The website is hosted on the same VPS using Nginx. Why does the bot react with :cancel: when using a comman? This will happen when the bot lacks the Send Message permission (But is able to react). Please make sure to give the right permissions for the bot to work properly!","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"bot/selfhosting/","text":"Some of you may want to selfhost the bot on your own VPS/server. This page explains how you can selfhost the bot for yourself. Important! By selfhosting the bot will you agree to the following terms: You follow the MIT-License of the bot. This means that you give credit to the original author (Andre_601) and won't claim this code as your own. You aknowledge and agree that you won't receive any support for your selfhosted bot. Requirements \u00b6 Before you can run the bot will you need to make sure that the following requirements are met. RethinkDB \u00b6 You need to have RethinkDB installed and running on your server, where the bot will later run. This also includes creating databases and tables to later set in the config.json. Java \u00b6 You need at least Java 8 to be installed and working. Newer versions of Java should work too. Setup \u00b6 When you made sure, that the requirements are met, can you continue with preparing the code. Clone the repository \u00b6 Clone/Fork the PurrBot repository, if you didn't already and open it in your preferred IDE. Make changes to code \u00b6 You need to alter specific parts of the code, to prevent errors from appearing. Alternatively could you set \"beta\" in the config.json to true, to set the bot as Beta-Bot, disabling certain functionalities such as posting stats to Bot Lists. When making changes to the code should you remove or uncomment the following code-snippets in PurrBot.java : public void startUpdater (){ if ( ! isBeta ()){ PostAction post = new PostAction ( getShardManager ()); BotBlockAPI botBlockAPI = new BotBlockAPI .

Config.json \u00b6 The config.json is the core file of the bot in which you set various different information that will be used by the bot. On first startup will it generate with the below default values. Default Config.json { \"bot-token\" : \"TOKEN\" , \"beta\" : false , \"webhooks\" : { \"guild\" : \"guild-webhook-url\" , \"log\" : \"log-webhook-url\" }, \"tokens\" : { \"blaze\" : \"blaze-token\" , \"discord-bots-gg\" : \"dbgg-token\" , \"lbots-org\" : \"lbots-token\" , \"botlist-space\" : \"botlist-token\" , \"discordextremelist-xyz\" : \"debl-token\" , \"discord-boats\" : \"discord-boats-token\" }, \"database\" : { \"ip\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"name\" : \"DatabaseName\" , \"guildTable\" : \"GuildTable\" } } Note that you don't have to set values for every option in the config.json.

In order for the list to work will they require an empty line between the list, and any displayed text above them.

Entry 1 Entry 2 Entry 3 This list, however, won't work. - Entry 1 - Entry 2 - Entry 3 In addition to the above requirement will you also need to use 4 spaces compared to the usual 2, when you want to indent the list.

Lists Still need an empty line Info The title can be omited. The box will then use the name of its type. I want to point out those specific things: You don't need to add two spaces after the !!! <type> \"<title>\" . MkDocs can handle this just fine. You need to add at least one empty line before and after the info box to not have unwanted formatting issues. Types \u00b6 The info boxes have various types available which you can choose from: Note Summary Info Tip Success Question Warning Failure Danger Bug Example Quote Collapsable info boxes (Details) \u00b6 This feature requires the Details extension from PyMdown . Those boxes are similar to the normal info boxes, but can be collapsed (closed) or opened. They follow the same syntax as the info boxes, but use question marks ( ? ) instead of exclamation marks ( ! ). You can use the exact same types as with the info boxes. Collapsable Box example Markdown ??? info \"Title\" This box is closed by default ---- ???+ info \"Title\" Adding a + after the question mark makes this box open by default. Result Title This box is closed by default Title Adding a + after the question mark makes this box open by default. Tabs \u00b6 This feature requires the Tabbed extension from PyMdown . Adds tabbed Markdown to list content after each other. This was used here for the various Markdown examples and their results. The syntax is the same as with the info box, with the difference that it uses equal signs ( = ) instead of exclamation marks ( ! ). Additionally does it also not have a type parameter, meaning you can only set the tile itself. Tabs example Markdown === \"Tab 1\" You can add more tabs... === \"Tab 2\" ...by adding extra `===`. ===! \"Tab A\" Using a ! after the equal signs... === \"Tab B\" ...indicates a new set of tabs. Result Tab 1 You can add more tabs... Tab 2 ...by adding extra === . Tab A Using a ! after the equal signs... Tab B ...indicates a new set of tabs. Links \u00b6 We use the PyMdown extension MagicLink which allows us to automatically transform links into clickable links. This doesn't happen by default. Link example Markdown https://purrbot.site Result https://purrbot.site Additionally can we link to a repository or GitHub user by just using the format @user/repo and @user respectively.

You can use them like normal emojis, with the difference, that they are prefixed with one of the following namespaces: fontawesome FontAwesome icons. You also need to specify the type as listed below. fontawesome-brands for brand icons fontawesome-regular for regular icons fontawesome-solid for solid icons material Material Design icons. octicons GitHub's Octicon icons.
